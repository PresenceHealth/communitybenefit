,Community Benefit Data Workbook,
,,
,,
,This workbook is used to compile data used in the Community Touch application at https://presencehealth.github.io/communitytouch.,
,,
,Yearly data,
,,This workbook reflects the finalized yearly data as seen in the annual AG/IRS workbooks.
,Quarterly data,
,,"We make an attempt to provide quarterly numbers. For non-financial categories this is generally accurate and reflects what is in CBISA. For financial categories, sometimes we don't have the full data."
,,"Yearly numbers are shown in orange if they do not match the quarterly numbers that make up that year. This can help you find typos and miscalculations, but in historical data it's the quarters that are incomplete, not the years. "
,,Quarterly numbers have not been vetted to the same extent as annual numbers.
,,
,Formatting,
,,- Filling out metadata: you'll notice that the columns provided in the data files determine a lot.
,,"  Column names need to take the format ""XXXXXXXXXX - YYYYYYYY"" where XXXXXXXXXX is the name of the category,"
,,"  and YYYYYYYYYYY is the units (such as Amount, Billings, or Persons served). You need to use this format"
,,  even if you're only providing one column for the category. % of revenue is calculated automatically for each
,,  category. Non-community benefit categories (included in the NonCB grouping below) do not need to specify units.
,,"- All data files need to have the same categories and the same rows, and the rows need to be in the same order. Just"
,,"  provide rows or columns full of null values if you need to, but make sure you provide them. The columns do not need "
,,"  to be in any order--even columns for the same category--except that ""Period"" needs to be the first column."
,,
,Field notes,
,,Cost-to-Charge Ratio: Defined using rolling 12-month average. E.g. the CCR for Q2 2017 is a CCR estimate over Q3 2016 - Q2 2017.
,,Financial assistance persons served: Yearly numbers are smaller than the sum of quarterly numbers because we de-duplicate for patients appearing in more than one quarter.
,,Medicaid persons served: yearly numbers are smaller than the sum of quarterly numbers because we de-duplicate for patients appearing in more than one quarter.
